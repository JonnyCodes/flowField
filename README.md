#README!!

Messing around trying to create water simulation, using a flow field based off aniamted perlin noise.
Might become a project in the future.

TODO:
------

+Look at moveing the agents based on the gradient vector (bright to dark) of the noise.
	+ This will allow me to place bright white obstacles and the agents will always avoid them.
