#README!!

Messing around trying to create water simulation, using a flow field based off animated perlin noise.
Might become a project in the future.

TODO:
------

+ Look at moving the agents based on the gradient vector (bright to dark) of the noise. - This will allow me to place bright white obstacles and the agents will always avoid them.
+ The above case mgiht require putting a left to right, white to black gradient over the perlin noise.
